# PRESENTATION OF THE GAME
***Inspired by the original _"Pac-Man"_ created by _Toru Iwatani_. The game 
was first published in 1980 by _Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc._*** 

## GENERAL
- Powered by ***Nicolo***
- Recommended Resolution: _1280x720_ 
- Developed in Python 3.8

## HOW TO START
To start the game simply run with Python3 the file "main.py" in the "bin" 
folder. Once the menu is shown press "New Game" to start playing.

***IMPORTANT:*** _Do not delete any of the files contained in the "bin" and 
"files" folder as doing so will jeopardize the integrity of the game. The 
files contained in the "save" folder may be removed at any point after they 
are created, but this may incur in the loss of data._

## HOW TO PLAY
The player controls the circle (the so-called "Pac-Man") that at the start 
is at the center of the maze. Try to collect as many coins as possible and 
avoid the contact with the other 4 circles that appear (the so-called 
"ghosts"). If all the coins are collected the game will end, thus the player 
will have won the game.

## NEW GAME/CONTINUE
In the main menu the user has the possibility to start a new game or 
to continue an old one, respectively pressing "New Game" or "Continue".
The user has the possibility to save his or her progress through the pause 
menu. If no past save is found when pressing "Continue" the game will 
automatically start a new game.

## SETTINGS
The game is highly customizable. Through the settings menu, the user can 
change any of the key used to play, the difficulty of the game
and the color of the player.

### Default Settings
| Action | Key |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Move Left | `<Left>` |
| Move Right | `<Right>` |
| Move Up | `<Up>` |
| Move Down | `<Down>` |
| Pause/Resume | `<space>` |
| Cheat codes | `<c>`/`<x>`|
| Boss Key | `<b>` |
| Difficulty | `normal` |
| Player Color | `yellow` |

***PLEASE NOTE:*** _The game is case-sensitive; for example "c" 
(lowercase) and "C" (uppercase) are considered two different controls._

### Resume
By pressing the pause control the user can stop the game at any point.
The user can then either resume the game (either by pressing "Resume" 
or by pressing the pause control again) or go back to the menu. From the 
pause menu the user has also the possibility to save his or her progress 
which will be stored and held on even after closing the program. 

### Cheat Code
The game offers two cheat codes. If the first cheat code is pressed the player 
will have a higher speed, which will make running away from ghosts 
extremely easy. If the first cheat code is pressed a gain the player will 
return to its normal speed. If the second cheat code is pressed the enemy 
will dramatically slow down. Again if the second cheat code is pressed the 
enemies will go back to normal speed.

### Boss Key
Once the boss key is pressed the game will be paused and the window will
pretend to be a todo list. Once the boss key is pressed again the window 
will go back to normal and the user will be able to continue to play.

### Difficulty 
The user can decide between two options "norma" and "hard". The difference 
is in the speed of the ghosts.

### Player Color 
The user can customize the color of the player. This can be either the name
(e.g. _blue_ or _red_) or the hexadecimal value including the "#"
(e.g #AAE0B1).

## LEADERBOARD
When the game is over the player will have the possibility to enter his or 
her name, this together with the score will be saved and the top 8 scores 
will be visible in the leaderboard page.
